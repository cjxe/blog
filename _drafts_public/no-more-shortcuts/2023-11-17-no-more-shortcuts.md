If you are anything like me, you have experienced this harmful experience. It's **like a drug**: it starts very sweet and innocent, and then the process starts failing; but the caveat is **you can't stop doing it**. You know it's harmful, but you still keep on doing it, because you think it's going to save you **since it already saved you in the past**. Some call it **addiction**, but I call it dedication ðŸ˜Ž

# What the heck am I talking about!?
I want to think that every one of you (reader) has experienced the beauty of **Googling**. If not, give it a try: navigate to [google.com](https://google.com) and ask a question. The result will blow your mind! Now do this for **all your questions**, and try to find the correct answers. 

This is a problem, and it's called **over-Googling**. 

# Lucky n00b
I attended a British university and studied **Computer Science**. In this area, we **constantly solve problems**, and some problems are difficult. However, I was lucky to have:

- **problems that were previously solved by others**
- **plenty of resources** to research these problems
- **the internet** to access plenty of resources

Considering the bullet points above, asking a senior before trying to find the answer on my own is selfish (assuming their time and energy are useful elsewhere). 

However, not being able to contact a senior super easily was a challenging process for me, because that was what I was used to; so I was shocked when they didn't attempt to solve my problem.

# Cultural challenges
Before attending university, I attended **a Turkish high school** in Turkiye (formerly Turkey). Naturally, I had many school-related problems that I needed to solve. After studying in the UK, I realised that solving problems in Turkiye is *slightly* different from solving problems in the UK:

| ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· | ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ |
| ------ | ------- |
| Questioning is not always encouraged | Questioning is almost always encouraged |
| Not knowing everything is shameful | Not knowing everything is normal |
| Seniors must know everything | Seniors mustn't know everything |
| People are too helpful | People are helpful |
| Human life is not very valuable (so, one's time is not valuable) | Every human is valuable (so, one's time is valuable) |

So, whenever I had a problem in Turkiye, I knew what to do: **find a senior and resolve the problem together**. I assumed they knew the answer, and if they didn't, they would hold my hand and try to solve the problem together. 

For me, this was the norm to solve problems; so imagine my shock and horror when I was refused to be given help in university.

# Discovering "Googling"
In my first year of university, **I was already behind my peers** since I didn't do Computer Science A-levels. This was an issue because **we were given the same assignments**, and the assignments were tailored to the average student (who did CS A-levels and took classes in English). I wanted to pass the year, so **I had to catch up with others** (preferably quickly).

To learn quickly, I needed to **leverage the power of a tool** that I hadn't used before, something that they used **to gain all that knowledge in a short amount of time**...

After attending a few web development practicals, I was taught the importance and usage of **Google** and the scarcity of my seniors' time and energy. I learned that I should try to solve the problem on my own, including Googling it, and then asking for help from my seniors. 

Do you know **the feeling of starting to do something new, and guessing you will do it more frequently, but it feels awkward** because you are in the process of learning it?

That was the exact feeling I experienced in my first week of university when I started Googling my questions before asking for help.

So,
- whenever I had a question related to programming, I Googled it.
- whenever I received an error, I Googled it.
- whenever I needed to learn something, I Googled it.
- [and he Googled away, Google Googleâ€¦until he couldnâ€™t solve problems without Google](https://youtu.be/MtN1YnoL46Q?si=mpabsTuc7gKQkT61)

# The fall
Eventually, being dependent on Google caught up with me, and it started to **negatively affect other aspects** of my life:

- Due to my experience with Google, I **assumed that everything on Google was true**.
- My **confidence decreased**.
- I started asking **Google to make decisions on my behalf**.
- Googleâ€™s answers **replaced my decisions**.
- I started losing **decision-making skills**.
- My **anxiety increased**.
- To decrease my anxiety, I Googled more to find out the *correct* answers.
- My anxiety increased even more.

At first, I was **blinded by the anxiety-inducing cycle** (and other negative experiences); because how come Google be harmful? I had a âœ¨proven track recordâœ¨ of incredible Googling skills AND finding the correct answers to my problems. 

# The tipping point
My **anxiety was so high**, that I couldn't solve problems or have normal relationships. I remember crying myself to sleep a few times because of this, and how everything else turned out. At the time, **my biggest wish was to be an average person**.

After a few weeks, I decided to prioritise my health and started searching for a therapist. I contacted some of my friends and asked if I could have a session with one of their therapists. Luckily, my friends replied quickly and **I managed to book a therapy session** in a week. I still remember how happy I was when I booked the session.

# The end, and the start of a brighter future
Fortunately, the therapy worked. As a result, I learned **how to deal with my emotions and feelings**. When dealing with emotion or feeling-related problems, I decided to **focus on "how X affects me" instead of "why I felt X"**. Trying to solve the "why" problems increased my anxiety, so I started accepting how things were. 

Well, that was a sidetrack. 

What was the main topic? Over-googling and the anxiety-inducing cycle.

At one point, my therapist and I realised that **some problems increased my anxiety**, and **I didn't spend the necessary time to process my feelings and emotions**. So, **poor feeling management negatively affected my decisions** (e.g., trying to quickly find an answer to an open problem by over-Googling), which **resulted in poor results** which were not in my favour.

My actions were understandable considering Googling had a tremendous effect in helping me to pass my modules, but I hadn't realised the harm it had done.

"It is never too late to mend."

So, I stopped Googling; started reading the error messages in the terminal, and debugging my code. I am happier.

# TL;DR
- Approaching to solve a problem is different across various cultures.
- Google might be an important step in finding a solution, but not the first step.
- Emotions and feelings affect decision-making (which affects problem-solving).
- Take time off when necessary.
