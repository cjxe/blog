Perhaps *communicating* is the most important skill when working with other people, and it is required for greater success. In this blog post, I list my thought process: before, while and after communicating.

# Why should you read *my* thought process?

- I value and take action to deliver high-impact solutions simply and quickly.
- I received (and continue to receive) the same feedback at school, university, work and personal life: "Baran, your communication is very clear and effective to get shit done quickly.".
- I value engineering and automation to the point that they are no longer valuable.

# My thought process on effective communication

## Plan (before communicating)

1. Acknowledge that you are talking to a human like yourself, so communicate with the recipient as you would like to be addressed by empathising.
2. Keep it simple to maximise clarity and focus.
  - E.g., Each letter/word/sentence is a spent resource of time and energy, so find a balance between sharing nothing at all and sharing everything. A question I ask myself is "What value does this letter add to the sentence?". If the added value is negative, then I remove that letter.
  - I.e., When the message is longer, then the recipient will be less motivated to read, or more likely to miss some details.
  - I.e., Use *active voice* (e.g., "I completed X.") instead of *passive voice* (e.g., "X was completed.") because active voice is easier to understand than passive voice.
3. Expand your knowledge to understand the assumptions, parameters, dependencies and the core problem.
  - E.g., Understand the problem by listening to or reading the recipient's problem.
  - E.g., Research the problem on your own to understand the problem, and where this problem stands in the bigger picture/problem/aim/domain.
4. Explore the impact of the problem to prioritise.
	- I.e., Time and energy are sacred resources. Most challenges are not impactful, and because I want to have the most impact, I drop/deprioritise/delegate not impactful problems.
5. Know your audience to speak at their level:
	- How knowledgeable is the recipient?
		- E.g., If the recipient is not technical, then they won't understand a technical language.
		- E.g., If the recipient is not from the same company, they will most likely not understand the company-wide terminology (e.g., acronyms).
		- E.g., If the recipient is not from your problem's domain, perhaps you are talking to the wrong person.
	- What culture is the recipient from? 
		- If the recipient is from a different culture, they might prefer communicating in different ways; because different cultures have different values. 
			- E.g., The Western culture values productivity/straightforwardness over kindness; whereas the Eastern culture values kindness over productivity. Furthermore, values like kindness have different meanings in different cultures.
6. Select the right communication channel to get the quickest and highest-quality response.
	- E.g., Escalating every issue will damage relationships in the long run; so get their minimum attention at the level that is required to make the most impact to solve your problem.
	- E.g., Verbal communication has a higher impact which resolves the problem quicker compared to written communication.

## Deliver (while communicating)

1. Follow a message structure to keep the communication flow organised:

```md
# Greeting (optional)

# Listen to the recipient (if the recipient started the conversation)
- make the recipient feel safe, understood, accepted and encouraged (e.g., by giving validations/appreciation with genuine/sincere desire)
- don't interrupt the recipient since they might mention something you want to ask and being interrupted is frustrating from the recipient's perspective
- don't speak for the recipient (e.g., You like doing X.); instead, ask questions (e.g., So, you are saying you like doing X?)
- ask for anything unclear to improve clarity
	- i.e., ask questions (e.g., What is X?) if you are unsure about anything
	- i.e., mirror the recipient with a question (e.g., So, ... ?) to let them confirm your understanding

# Provide Background/Context/Bigger picture (optional)
- don't use subjective words (e.g., very, good, bad)
- don't criticise/complain/share negativity
- stick to statistics/proofs/proven methods/past experiences
- if you want to give your opinion, make it clear that it is your opinion (e.g., _Perhaps_ we shouldn't do X, because Y?)
- list any assumptions/dependencies/risks

# Current problem that you are facing
- communicate 1 problem at a time
- use examples (sentences/images/videos/diagrams) if valuable

# Expected solution/Aim/What you want from this communication
- communicate 1 aim at a time
- use examples (sentences/images/videos/diagrams) if valuable

# Solutions that you have tried but failed
- use (listed) bullet points if more than one
- use examples (sentences/images/videos/diagrams) if valuable

# Questions
- use (listed) bullet points if more than one
- ask a maximum of 1 step ahead of the original question if possible
  - E.g., Did you finish doing X?
    - If so, could you also do Y?
    - If not, how can I help you to finish X?
- ask for feedback (e.g., "What do you think?") to improve for next time
- the least you can ask is "What do you think?" so the recipient feels in control and motivated enough to continue the communication

# Give your suggestions on your questions (optional)

# Make it clear that the conversation ended (optional)
```

- If communication is written, use automated tools to proofread any spelling or grammar mistakes to decrease overhead.

## Follow up (after communicating)

1. Agree on action items (if any) and a deadline to catch up (if necessary).
